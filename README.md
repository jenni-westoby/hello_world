WARNING: This repository contains some of my first attempts to write code, when my coding education was very minimal. My reason for putting this code on Github was because I wrote this code whilst carrying out an 8 week bioinformatics based research project as part of my undergraduate degree, and in order to make the project reproducible I put the code online. Please do not judge my current coding ability based on these files, and if you are considering using code in these files, maybe reconsider!
